our economy:
    influence per turn (accurate unless we are attacked)
        we also know that influence per turn (in version 2) is capped at SurplusPerRound per turn (?)
            
            Action Cooldown = 2

            turns per unit = (2 / passability of ec square) [2, 20]

            Maximum Production of Slanderer in lifetime = 1500

            Cost of Producing Slanderer = 949
            
            Maximum Profit of Slanderer = 551 
            
        

their economy:
    core assumption -> they will spend all their surplus (after building units) on bidding


== strategies == 

lowball bid 

    -> throw a bid up for like 50

    - if we win, keep it there or lower slightly
    --> (if people are going for annihilation and our politician wall can hold, then we would beat them on votes)
    
    - if we lose, double?
    --> check our influence per turn to create most sustainable bid 

    - if we continue to lose for multiple rounds in a row, increase greatly if our influence permits
    --> if they're bidding ridiculously high then it's probably unsustainable for them
    
if their unit composition is not matched to ours, adjust accordingly.
    -> we can encode this implicitly?
